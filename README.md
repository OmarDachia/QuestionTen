#9 WAP to swap 2 noâ€™s without using a third variable.
Let us see how this program works:

Initially, a = 5 and b = 10.
Then, we add a and b and store it in a with the code a = a + b. This means a = 5 + 10. So, a = 15 now.
Then we use the code b = a - b. This means b = 15 - 10. So, b = 5 now.
Again, we use the code a = a - b. This means a = 15 - 5. So finally, a = 10.
Hence, the numbers have been swapped.

Note: We can use multiplication and division instead of addition and subtraction. However, this won't work if one of the numbers is 0.
